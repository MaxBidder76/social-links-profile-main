## My process

I started by coloring the body background and gave it the styling tags that will make it mobile responsive. I then went ahead to create a block for my design using the div tag. I colored the div background, imported the image, then styled the texts and gave them the heading and paragraph tags. I then made my link paragraphs hover responsive.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

Changing the hover text color works on links if the cursor pointer is on the link text and not and the page background.

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
<div class="content">The class attribute</div>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
p:hover {    
    color: hsl(0, 0%, 12%);
    background-color: hsl(75, 94%, 57%);
    text-decoration: none;
}
```

### Continued development

I will continue practicing on using the color changing hover attribute. I really like that feature.
